# 🔴 RF Subliminal Simulation *(Educational)*  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer (Read First)**  
> This repository contains a **simulation-only** Python project that generates pulsed RF-like waveforms and visualizations inspired by the microwave auditory (Frey) effect.  
> **This project does NOT transmit any RF by itself**. It is strictly for education, research, and analysis in simulation.  
> Any attempt to use this code with high-power microwave transmitters or to aim energy at people is **illegal, dangerous, and unethical — do not do it.**

## 📡 What this project is  

This project is a software **signal generator and visualizer** that:

- 🎛 Creates a modulating audio envelope (tones / clicks) and maps it onto a pulsed waveform.  
- 💾 Produces complex IQ baseband samples representing a pulsed signal (saved as a binary `.bin` file).  
- 🎧 Creates a downsampled WAV (`simulated_perceived_clicks.wav`) that illustrates the kind of clicks/tones a human might perceive **in simulation**.  
- 📊 Generates visualization plots (`rf_subliminal_visualization.png`) and a parameters metadata file.

> 🧠 *Purpose*: Demonstrate and analyze waveform shapes and perceptual simulations described in historical patents and literature — not to produce or advise on real-world transmissions.

## 🗂 Files generated by the script (example)

- `rf_subliminal_iq.bin` — Complex64 IQ samples for analysis (simulation only).  
- `rf_subliminal_visualization.png` — Plot showing modulating signal, carrier representation and pulse train.  
- `simulated_perceived_clicks.wav` — An audible demonstration of the pulse train when downsampled (safe for headphones).  
- `rf_transmission_parameters.txt` — Metadata describing the parameters used for generation.  


## 🚀 How to use (simulation-only)

1. Clone the repository (or download the script).  
2. Install dependencies for simulation and visualization (`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `soundfile`).  
3. Run the script in its default mode (simulation / file generation) — **do not** enable transmission.

**Example (simulation mode):**

```bash
python rf_subliminal_simulation.py --duration 5 --fs 200000
This generates the IQ file, visualization PNG, metadata, and a simulated WAV you can listen to locally.

⚠️ Note: The script contains optional hooks for SDR transmission (HackRF / SoapySDR). Those paths are intentionally untested and are present for completeness only.
I do not provide instructions or support for transmitting RF or using high-power microwave hardware.

❌ What this is not and cannot do
This project cannot produce audible sound in someone’s head without appropriate transmission hardware (not provided). It only generates digital waveform samples and files.

It is not a recipe for building directed-energy devices, nor a how-to for targeting people.

The microwave auditory (Frey) effect — if created with specialized hardware in labs — is reported to produce clicks or simple tones, not clear intelligible speech.

⚖️ Safety, legality, and ethics
🛑 Intentionally exposing people to microwave or directed energy is dangerous, potentially harmful, and is regulated by national authorities. Do not attempt to transmit or cause exposures.

🛑 Do not provide or seek hardware configurations, power levels, antenna designs, or operational guidance that would enable real-world emission or targeting of people.

Simulation-only: for research/education. Not to be used for transmission or aimed at persons. Misuse may cause legal or physical harm.

✅ Safe alternatives and related demos
🎧 Psychoacoustic externalization demos — use binaural HRTF convolution and panning to make sounds appear external (safe on headphones).

🔍 Signal analysis — use GNU Radio or other analysis tools in receive/simulate mode.

📚 Literature review — study the published papers on the Frey effect and official investigations to understand scientific consensus and limits.

🤝 Contributing & responsible disclosure
🐛 Report bugs or suggest improvements via issues or PRs. Keep contributions focused on simulation, analysis, visualization, and safety documentation.

🛑 Do NOT contribute operational RF transmission instructions or hardware designs that could be used to harm people.
