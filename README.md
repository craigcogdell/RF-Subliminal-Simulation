# RF Subliminal Simulation (Educational)

**Disclaimer (read first)**

This repository contains a **simulation-only** Python project that generates pulsed RF-like waveforms and visualizations inspired by the microwave auditory (Frey) effect. **This project does NOT transmit any RF by itself**. It is strictly for education, research, and analysis in simulation. Any attempt to use this code with high-power microwave transmitters or to aim energy at people is illegal, dangerous, and unethical â€” do not do it.

---

## What this project is

This project is a software **signal generator and visualizer** that:

* Creates a modulating audio envelope (tones / clicks) and maps it onto a pulsed waveform.
* Produces complex IQ baseband samples representing a pulsed signal (saved as a binary `.bin` file).
* Creates a downsampled WAV (`simulated_perceived_clicks.wav`) that illustrates the kind of clicks/tones a human might perceive **in simulation**.
* Generates visualization plots (`rf_subliminal_visualization.png`) and a parameters metadata file.

The purpose is to *demonstrate and analyze the waveform shapes and perceptual simulations described in historical patents and literature* â€” not to produce or advise on real-world transmissions.

## Files generated by the script (example)

* `rf_subliminal_iq.bin` â€” Complex64 IQ samples for analysis (simulation only).
* `rf_subliminal_visualization.png` â€” Plot showing modulating signal, carrier representation and pulse train.
* `simulated_perceived_clicks.wav` â€” An audible demonstration of the pulse train when downsampled; meant for safe listening on headphones.
* `rf_transmission_parameters.txt` â€” Metadata describing the parameters used for generation.

## How to use (simulation-only)

1. Clone the repository (or download the script).
2. Install dependencies for simulation and visualization (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, soundfile).
3. Run the script in its default mode (simulation / file generation) â€” **do not** enable transmission.

**Example (simulation mode):**

```bash
python rf_subliminal_simulation.py --duration 5 --fs 200000
```

This will generate the IQ file, visualization PNG, metadata, and a simulated WAV you can listen to locally.

**Note:** The script contains optional hooks for SDR transmission (HackRF / SoapySDR). Those paths are intentionally untested in this repository and are present for completeness only. I do not provide instructions or support for transmitting RF or using high-power microwave hardware.

## What this *is not* and cannot do

* This project cannot and does not produce audible sound in someoneâ€™s head without appropriate transmission hardware (which is not provided). The code only generates digital waveform samples and files.
* It is **not** a recipe for building directed-energy devices, nor a how-to for targeting people.
* The microwave auditory (Frey) effect â€” if created with specialized hardware in laboratory settings â€” is reported to produce **clicks or simple tones**, not clear, intelligible speech. The scientific literature shows very limited bandwidth and fidelity for this effect.

## Safety, legality, and ethics

* Intentionally exposing people to microwave or directed energy is **dangerous**, potentially harmful, and is regulated by national authorities. Do not attempt to transmit or cause exposures.
* Do not provide or seek hardware configurations, power levels, antenna designs, or operational guidance that would enable real-world emission or targeting of people.
* If you share this repository, include this README and the following short disclaimer in any post or distribution:

> **Simulation-only: for research/education. Not to be used for transmission or aimed at persons. Misuse may cause legal or physical harm.**

## Safe alternatives and related demos

If your interest is educational (demonstrating how the brain perceives externalized audio), consider safer, legal alternatives:

* **Psychoacoustic externalization demos** â€” use binaural HRTF convolution, ITD/ILD panning, and reverberation to make sounds appear external on headphones. These are safe and highly effective for demos.
* **Signal analysis** â€” use GNU Radio or other analysis tools in receive/simulate mode to examine spectrum and pulse timing without transmitting.
* **Literature review** â€” study the published papers on the Frey effect and official investigations (Havana Syndrome reports) to understand scientific consensus and limits.

## Contributing & responsible disclosure

* If you find a bug in the simulation code, open an issue or a pull request. Keep contributions focused on simulation, analysis, visualization, and safety documentation.
* Do NOT contribute operational RF transmission instructions or hardware designs that could be used to harm people.

## License

This repository is intended for educational use. 

*This README was generated to accompany the simulation code and should be included alongside any distribution to make the project's intent and safety requirements explicit.*

### âš¡ Power *Behind the Static*

Behind the Static fights to end the silent war of **RF targeting** â€”  
turning static into **truth**, and truth into **action**.  

This work is **100% independent** and built on purpose, not funding.

Every cup helps keep the **signal alive** â€” and fuels the mission to **end the suffering**. ðŸ”´
